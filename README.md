## Synopsis

This is a Chrome extension which replaces all instances of the word 'Trump' with 'Snake' on your chrome webbrowser. Code can be easily manipulated to change a word/phrase with a different word/phrase of your choosing.

## Motivation

Made during the 2016 Presidental election cycle as a joke.

## Tests

Chrome extensions require a "manifest.json" file that includes a name, description, and version prior to uploading on Chrome. 
Your chrome://extensions/ page has a link to load unpacked extensions, to which you upload a directory to these files. Must be in developer mode.
